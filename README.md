This project is a Python desktop application that predicts future stock prices using real market data. It downloads historical price information from Yahoo Finance through the yfinance library and uses an ARIMA model to generate a forecast for the upcoming days. The application includes a clean and easy-to-use Tkinter interface where the user enters a stock ticker symbol and the number of days they want to predict. After processing, the app displays a detailed plot showing both the past closing prices and the predicted future values. It also includes basic error handling, input validation, and a loading indicator to make the experience smooth. This project demonstrates how data extraction, time-series modeling, and GUI development can be combined into a functional stock prediction tool.
